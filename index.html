        How did it happend?

    </h2>
    <i>
    <strong> It happend because <ins>Germany</ins>
    </strong> <Br />needed to pay money to winning countries
    <li>specafically Great britian and fracne.<Br /> Germany was
    very poor at that time and they did not 
    have enough money to pay the winning countries<Br />
    Germany had no choice but to print a lot of money to pay the countires<Br />
    As expected Germany had a big infliation<Br />
    infact it was the worst inflation in human history. German money was so useless that kids played football with the money.<Br />
    when  germany printed a lot of money
    it caused infliation

<P>
    One of the many reasons why Germany became poor was because<Br />
    they lost WWI<Br />
    WWI really made germany weak and they lost a lot of things because of that.
